it is backend so we dont have any access to dom and other frontend code but we can have access to server side of it like acessig the file system and much more.
  node contains two environment which is more like a console
  1. first is repl that stands for read evaluate print loop and it is the basic one.and we can have acess of it by typing simply node.
  2. second is cli which stand for command line interface which we can have acess by writing node and the js file name along with it in the terminal.
Globals are some command that we can access everywhere in our  entire project
